    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "Ans. Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization methods. It differs from other regression techniques by adding both penalties to the loss function, allowing it to handle high-dimensional datasets, perform feature selection, and deal with multicollinearity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans. To choose optimal regularization parameter values (alpha and l1_ratio) for Elastic Net Regression, techniques like cross-validation or grid search can be used. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into subsets, training the model on different combinations, and evaluating performance. Grid search tries different parameter combinations and selects the best-performing one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans. Advantages of Elastic Net Regression include handling high-dimensional data, performing feature selection, and addressing multicollinearity. However, it can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are some common use cases for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans. Common use cases for Elastic Net Regression include finance, economics, genetics, and social sciences. It is useful when dealing with datasets having many features, multicollinearity, or when feature selection is desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans. Coefficients in Elastic Net Regression represent the relationship between independent variables and the target variable. Positive coefficients indicate a positive relationship, negative coefficients indicate a negative relationship, and the magnitude represents the strength of the relationship. However, interpreting coefficients can be challenging due to regularization effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How do you handle missing values when using Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans. Missing values in Elastic Net Regression can be handled by imputing them using techniques like mean or median imputation, regression imputation, or multiple imputations. Appropriate handling of missing values is crucial to avoid bias in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How do you use Elastic Net Regression for feature selection?\n",
    "Ans.Elastic Net Regression can be used for feature selection by examining the magnitude of coefficients. Non-zero coefficients indicate important features that can be selected for further analysis. Techniques like recursive feature elimination or stability selection can enhance the feature selection process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How do you pickle and unpickle a trained Elastic Net Regression model in Python?\n",
    "Ans.In Python, you can pickle and unpickle a trained Elastic Net Regression model using the  pickle  module. To pickle a model, use  pickle.dump()  to save the model object to a file. To unpickle, use  pickle.load()  to load the saved model object from the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What is the purpose of pickling a model in machine learning?\n",
    "Ans Pickling a model in machine learning serves the purpose of saving the trained model object to a file for later use. It allows storing model parameters, coefficients, and other necessary information, enabling the model to be loaded and used without retraining. This is useful for deployment in production environments or sharing the model with others.\n"
